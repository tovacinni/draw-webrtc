# draw-webrtc

This is a small demo I made in 2023 so that I can learn WebRTC and also play around with LCMLoRA on my iPad. 

It has support to look at a screenshared window from an iPad and stream that into LCMLoRA to perform image to image. 

Putting this on the internet as a relatively minimal example of using WebRTC for this sort of demo in case it's useful!

This repo is a hack- don't use this as a reference for good code!
